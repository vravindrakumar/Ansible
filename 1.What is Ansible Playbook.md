# What is Ansible Playbook

An **Ansible Playbook** is a YAML file containing a series of tasks that Ansible uses to automate the configuration, deployment, and management of systems. Playbooks are the building blocks of Ansible, allowing users to describe a set of steps in a structured format that can be executed sequentially across multiple hosts.

### Key Concepts in Ansible Playbooks:

1. **Plays**: A play is a collection of tasks executed on a group of hosts. Each play in a playbook is executed in order.
   
2. **Tasks**: Tasks are the individual steps that Ansible takes to achieve the desired state on the remote system. Each task typically consists of a module and its arguments.
   
3. **Modules**: Modules are the units of work in Ansible. They perform specific operations, such as installing packages, managing services, or modifying files.

4. **Variables**: Variables are used to customize the behavior of tasks. They can be defined at various levels, such as playbook level, host level, or group level.

5. **Handlers**: Handlers are tasks that are only run when triggered by other tasks. They are often used for operations that need to occur only when something has changed, like restarting a service after a configuration file is updated.

6. **Roles**: Roles are a way to organize playbooks and group related tasks together. They help in reusing code and managing complex playbooks.

7. **Conditionals and Loops**: Playbooks support conditional statements and loops to control the execution of tasks based on certain conditions or to iterate over lists of items.

### Example 1: Basic Playbook to Install and Start Nginx

This playbook installs and starts the Nginx web server on a group of hosts.

```yaml
---
- name: Install and start Nginx
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes  # Run tasks with sudo
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
```

**Explanation**:
- The `hosts: webservers` indicates that the play will run on all hosts in the "webservers" group.
- The `become: yes` directive tells Ansible to run tasks with elevated privileges (sudo).
- The first task installs the Nginx package using the `apt` module, but only if the host's OS family is Debian.
- The second task starts the Nginx service using the `service` module.

### Example 2: Creating a User and Deploying SSH Key

This playbook creates a new user and deploys an SSH key for passwordless authentication.

```yaml
---
- name: Create a new user and deploy SSH key
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars:
    user_name: devops
    ssh_key: "{{ lookup('file', 'files/id_rsa.pub') }}"
  tasks:
    - name: Create a user
      user:
        name: "{{ user_name }}"
        state: present
        shell: /bin/bash

    - name: Create .ssh directory
      file:
        path: "/home/{{ user_name }}/.ssh"
        state: directory
        owner: "{{ user_name }}"
        group: "{{ user_name }}"
        mode: '0700'

    - name: Deploy authorized key
      copy:
        content: "{{ ssh_key }}"
        dest: "/home/{{ user_name }}/.ssh/authorized_keys"
        owner: "{{ user_name }}"
        group: "{{ user_name }}"
        mode: '0600'
```

**Explanation**:
- This playbook runs on all hosts.
- It creates a user named `devops`, creates an `.ssh` directory in the user's home directory, and copies an SSH public key to `authorized_keys`.
- The `vars` section defines variables that are used throughout the playbook.

### Example 3: Deploying a Web Application

This playbook deploys a simple HTML web application to a web server.

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy a web application
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Copy index.html to the web server
      copy:
        src: files/index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
        owner: www-data
        group: www-data
        mode: '0644'

    - name: Ensure Apache is running
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

**Explanation**:
- The playbook installs Apache, copies an `index.html` file to the appropriate directory, and ensures that the Apache service is running.
- The `when` condition ensures that the Apache installation task only runs on Debian-based systems.

### Summary

Ansible Playbooks provide a powerful way to automate complex IT tasks. They are highly readable and allow for modular, reusable code. By using plays, tasks, variables, handlers, and roles, you can create sophisticated automation scripts that are easy to manage and extend.
