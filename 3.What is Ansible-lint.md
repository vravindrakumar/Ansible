# What is Ansible-lint

**Ansible-lint** is a command-line tool used to check Ansible playbooks for best practices and coding standards. It helps identify potential issues in Ansible code by analyzing playbooks, roles, and tasks against a set of predefined rules. These rules can catch common mistakes, enforce style guidelines, and suggest improvements to ensure that the code is maintainable, efficient, and secure.

### Key Features:
- **Customizable Rules:** Ansible-lint allows the use of custom rules or the modification of existing ones to fit the specific needs of a project.
- **Integration with CI/CD:** It can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automatically check playbooks before deployment.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Provides detailed feedback and suggestions for improving Ansible code.

### Example 1: Checking a Playbook for Deprecated Modules

Imagine you have a simple Ansible playbook that uses a deprecated module:

```yaml
---
- name: Deprecated module example
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Using the `shell` module instead of `command`
      shell: echo "This is not recommended"
```

Running `ansible-lint` on this playbook might produce a warning like:

```bash
[301] Use command instead of shell
playbook.yml:4
Task/Handler: Using the `shell` module instead of `command`
```

This indicates that it's generally better to use the `command` module instead of `shell` to avoid potential security risks and ensure idempotency.

### Example 2: Detecting Hard-Coded Paths

Consider another playbook where a hard-coded path is used:

```yaml
---
- name: Hard-coded path example
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Copy file to a specific location
      copy:
        src: /home/user/file.txt
        dest: /etc/app/file.txt
```

Running `ansible-lint` might yield a warning like:

```bash
[601] Don't hard-code paths in the tasks
playbook.yml:5
Task/Handler: Copy file to a specific location
```

This warning suggests avoiding hard-coded paths and instead using variables to make the playbook more flexible and portable. For example:

```yaml
---
- name: Improved path handling example
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    user_home: "/home/user"
  tasks:
    - name: Copy file to a specific location
      copy:
        src: "{{ user_home }}/file.txt"
        dest: /etc/app/file.txt
```

### Conclusion

Ansible-lint is a valuable tool for maintaining high-quality Ansible code by enforcing best practices and helping developers catch common errors early in the development process. Integrating it into your workflow ensures that your playbooks are more reliable, secure, and easier to maintain.
