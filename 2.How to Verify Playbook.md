# How to Verify Playbook?

**Check mode** and **Diff mode** in Ansible are powerful features that allow you to validate and preview changes in your playbooks before applying them to your infrastructure. Here's a detailed explanation of each mode with examples.

### Check Mode (Dry Run)

**Check Mode** (`--check`) allows you to simulate the execution of a playbook without making any actual changes to the target systems. This is useful for testing and validating the playbook's logic.

#### How It Works:
- Ansible performs a "dry run," where it goes through all the tasks in the playbook and determines what changes would be made, but it doesn't actually execute those changes.
- It is particularly helpful for validating that your playbook will not cause any unintended side effects.

#### Example Playbook: `configure_ssh.yml`
```yaml
---
- name: Configure SSH settings
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure the SSH service is running
      service:
        name: ssh
        state: started

    - name: Update SSH configuration file
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^#PermitRootLogin'
        line: 'PermitRootLogin no'
        state: present

    - name: Restart SSH service
      service:
        name: ssh
        state: restarted
```

#### Running in Check Mode:
```bash
ansible-playbook configure_ssh.yml --check
```

**Explanation:**
- This command runs the playbook in check mode.
- It will show what changes would be made (e.g., the SSH configuration file would be modified), but it won't actually restart the SSH service or modify the file.

### Diff Mode

**Diff Mode** (`--diff`) is used to show the differences between the current state of a file and the changes that would be made by the playbook. Itâ€™s particularly useful for configuration management, where you need to see exactly what lines in a file will be added, removed, or modified.

#### How It Works:
- When enabled, Ansible will display the differences (like a `diff` command) between the current state of files and the desired state as defined in the playbook.
- It helps in understanding the exact impact of the changes before applying them.

#### Example Playbook: `update_config.yml`
```yaml
---
- name: Update web server configuration
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update Nginx configuration
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
        regexp: '^worker_processes'
        line: 'worker_processes 4;'
        state: present

    - name: Reload Nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: reloaded
```

#### Running in Diff Mode:
```bash
ansible-playbook update_config.yml --diff
```

**Explanation:**
- This command runs the playbook and shows a diff of what changes would be made to the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file.
- It highlights the exact lines that will be modified, providing visibility into the impact of the playbook.

### Combining Check Mode and Diff Mode

You can combine **Check Mode** and **Diff Mode** to get a comprehensive view of what changes will occur without applying them. This is particularly useful for cautious updates where you need to be sure of the exact changes before proceeding.

#### Example Command:
```bash
ansible-playbook update_config.yml --check --diff
```

**Explanation:**
- This command performs a dry run (`--check`) and also shows the diffs (`--diff`) for files that would be changed.
- It provides a complete overview of what the playbook will do, without making any actual changes to the system.

### Summary:

- **Check Mode (`--check`)**: Validates what changes would occur without actually applying them. Useful for testing and verifying the logic of your playbook.
- **Diff Mode (`--diff`)**: Shows the exact changes to files, making it clear what the playbook will modify. Useful for understanding the impact of file changes.

Both of these modes are valuable tools in ensuring that your Ansible playbooks are safe, accurate, and do exactly what you intend them to do.
