# Ansible variables

Ansible variables are a key part of the automation and configuration management process in Ansible. They allow you to customize tasks, roles, and playbooks by defining values that can change depending on the environment or other conditions. Below is a detailed explanation of different types of Ansible variables, with examples for each.

### 1. **Playbook Variables**
These are the most common variables, defined directly within a playbook. They can be specific to a play or a host.

**Example:**
```yaml
- hosts: webservers
  vars:
    http_port: 80
    max_clients: 200

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Apache is installed
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start Apache service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started

    - name: Configure Apache
      template:
        src: /srv/httpd.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd.conf
```
In this example, `http_port` and `max_clients` are playbook variables that are used within the play.

### 2. **Host Variables**
Host variables are specific to an individual host. They can be defined in the inventory file or in separate host variable files.

**Inventory file example:**
```ini
[webservers]
webserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.100 http_port=8080
webserver2 ansible_host=192.168.1.101 http_port=9090
```
Here, `http_port` is a host variable specific to `webserver1` and `webserver2`.

**Host variable file example:**
```
# File: host_vars/webserver1.yaml
http_port: 8080
```
Host variables are used for customizing configurations based on the specific host.

### 3. **Group Variables**
Group variables apply to all hosts within a particular group. They are defined in the inventory file or in separate group variable files.

**Inventory file example:**
```ini
[webservers]
webserver1
webserver2

[webservers:vars]
http_port=80
```
Here, `http_port` is a group variable that applies to all hosts in the `webservers` group.

**Group variable file example:**
```
# File: group_vars/webservers.yaml
http_port: 80
```
Group variables help manage common configurations for a group of hosts.

### 4. **Role Variables**
Role variables are defined within a role and are used to customize the behavior of that role. These can be defined in `defaults/main.yml`, `vars/main.yml`, or other places within the role.

**Example:**
```yaml
# File: roles/apache/defaults/main.yml
http_port: 80
max_clients: 200
```
In this example, `http_port` and `max_clients` are role variables with default values that can be overridden when the role is used.

### 5. **Extra Variables (`--extra-vars`)**
Extra variables are defined at the command line when running a playbook. They can override other variables.

**Example:**
```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --extra-vars "http_port=8080"
```
Here, `http_port` is set to `8080`, overriding any previous definition.

### 6. **Facts**
Facts are variables that are automatically discovered by Ansible from managed hosts. They include details about the system like IP address, hostname, operating system, etc.

**Example:**
```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Print the IP address of the host
      debug:
        msg: "The IP address is {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}"
```
Here, `ansible_default_ipv4.address` is a fact representing the host's default IPv4 address.

### 7. **Registered Variables**
Registered variables are created when the result of a task is stored in a variable. They are useful for making decisions based on the outcome of previous tasks.

**Example:**
```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Check if a file exists
      stat:
        path: /etc/passwd
      register: file_exists

    - name: Print file status
      debug:
        msg: "File exists: {{ file_exists.stat.exists }}"
```
Here, `file_exists` is a registered variable containing the result of the `stat` task.

### 8. **Environment Variables**
Environment variables can be defined within a play or task to modify the environment in which commands are executed.

**Example:**
```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Run a command with a custom environment variable
      shell: echo $MYVAR
      environment:
        MYVAR: hello_world
```
Here, `MYVAR` is an environment variable that is available during the execution of the `shell` task.

### 9. **Magic Variables**
Magic variables are special variables provided by Ansible, which contain information about the current playbook run, host, or task.

**Examples:**
- `hostvars`: Access variables of other hosts.
- `group_names`: List of groups the current host is part of.
- `inventory_hostname`: The name of the current host as defined in the inventory.

**Example usage:**
```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Print current host's inventory name
      debug:
        msg: "This host is {{ inventory_hostname }}"
```

### 10. **Jinja2 Template Variables**
Ansible uses Jinja2 templating, allowing variables to be defined and used within templates. You can use conditionals, loops, and filters with these variables.

**Example:**
```yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create a configuration file from a template
      template:
        src: nginx.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
In `nginx.conf.j2`, you can have something like:
```jinja
server {
    listen {{ http_port }};
    server_name {{ inventory_hostname }};
}
```

### Summary
Ansible variables provide flexibility and power to your automation scripts, allowing you to manage and customize configurations across different environments and hosts efficiently. Understanding how to use these variables effectively can significantly enhance your Ansible playbooks and roles.
