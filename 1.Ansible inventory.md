# Ansible inventory

Ansible inventory is a crucial component of Ansible's configuration management system. It is essentially a list or database that defines the hosts (servers or nodes) Ansible will manage. The inventory can include IP addresses, domain names, and groupings of these hosts. It also allows for setting variables that can control the behavior of Ansible playbooks on these hosts.

### Types of Ansible Inventory

1. **Static Inventory:** A simple text file (usually named `hosts` or `inventory`) that lists the IP addresses or hostnames of your servers.
2. **Dynamic Inventory:** A script or plugin that dynamically generates an inventory based on external sources like cloud providers (AWS, Azure), CMDB, or any other dynamic environment.

### Static Inventory Example

#### Example 1: Basic Inventory File

```ini
[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[databases]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com

[all:vars]
ansible_user=admin
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**Explanation:**
- `[webservers]` and `[databases]` are groups of servers. You can define as many groups as you need.
- `all:vars` is a special section where you can define variables that apply to all hosts in the inventory. In this case, `ansible_user` is set to `admin`, and the private SSH key is specified.

#### Example 2: Inventory with Variables per Host

```ini
[webservers]
web1.example.com ansible_port=2222 ansible_user=webadmin
web2.example.com ansible_port=2223 ansible_user=webadmin

[databases]
db1.example.com ansible_port=3306 ansible_user=dbadmin
db2.example.com ansible_port=3306 ansible_user=dbadmin
```

**Explanation:**
- You can specify variables directly after the hostnames. Here, `ansible_port` and `ansible_user` are defined per host.

### Dynamic Inventory Example

Dynamic inventory scripts are useful when working in environments where servers are not static, such as cloud environments.

#### Example: AWS EC2 Dynamic Inventory

```bash
[ec2]
plugin = aws_ec2
regions = us-west-2
filters = {'instance-state-name': 'running'}
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags.Name
    prefix: tag
  - key: instance_id
    prefix: instance
```

**Explanation:**
- `plugin = aws_ec2` tells Ansible to use the AWS EC2 plugin to fetch the inventory.
- `regions = us-west-2` limits the inventory to a specific region.
- `filters` can be used to narrow down which instances are included, such as by their state (e.g., running).
- `keyed_groups` allows grouping hosts by instance attributes like tags or IDs.

### Host Variables and Group Variables

You can define variables for a specific host or for all hosts within a group.

#### Example: Group Variables

```ini
[webservers:vars]
http_port=80
max_clients=200

[databases:vars]
db_name=myapp
```

**Explanation:**
- `http_port` and `max_clients` are defined for all servers in the `webservers` group.
- `db_name` is defined for all servers in the `databases` group.

### Using Inventory in a Playbook

Here's how you might use this inventory in a playbook:

```yaml
- name: Configure web servers
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Apache is installed
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start Apache service
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
```

**Explanation:**
- The playbook is targeting the `webservers` group from the inventory.
- It ensures that Apache (`httpd`) is installed and running on all servers in that group.

### Summary

Ansible inventory is versatile and can be as simple or complex as needed, depending on the environment. You can define static inventories for small, stable environments or use dynamic inventories to integrate with cloud services, making it easier to manage and scale.
