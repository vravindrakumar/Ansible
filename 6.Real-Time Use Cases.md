# Real-Time Use Cases

### Real-Time Example 1: Automating Web Server Deployment

**Scenario:** You need to deploy a web server (like Apache) across multiple servers.

**Playbook:**

```yaml
---
- name: Install and configure Apache Web Server
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Apache is installed
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
    
    - name: Ensure Apache service is running and enabled
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes
    
    - name: Copy the index.html to the web server document root
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        src: /path/to/local/index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
        mode: '0644'
    
    - name: Open HTTP port in firewall
      ansible.builtin.firewalld:
        port: 80/tcp
        permanent: yes
        state: enabled
```

**Explanation:**
- **hosts:** Defines the target group of servers.
- **become:** Elevates privileges (like using `sudo`).
- **tasks:** The list of tasks to be performed:
  - Install Apache.
  - Ensure the Apache service is running and enabled at startup.
  - Copy a custom `index.html` file to the server.
  - Open the HTTP port in the firewall.

**Execution:** 
Run the playbook with the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory_file playbook.yml
```

### Real-Time Example 2: Managing Users and Groups

**Scenario:** You need to create a group, add users to this group, and set specific permissions.

**Playbook:**

```yaml
---
- name: Manage users and groups
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  
  tasks:
    - name: Create a new group
      ansible.builtin.group:
        name: developers
        state: present
    
    - name: Create new users and add them to the group
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        groups: developers
        state: present
      with_items:
        - user1
        - user2
    
    - name: Set directory permissions for the developers group
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /opt/developers
        state: directory
        mode: '0775'
        owner: root
        group: developers
```

**Explanation:**
- **group:** Creates a group named "developers".
- **user:** Creates users `user1` and `user2`, adding them to the "developers" group.
- **file:** Ensures the `/opt/developers` directory exists with the right permissions.

**Execution:** 
Run the playbook as follows:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory_file user_management.yml
```

### Conclusion
These examples showcase how Ansible can automate tasks like web server deployment and user management. By using Ansible, you can save time, reduce errors, and ensure consistency across your infrastructure.
