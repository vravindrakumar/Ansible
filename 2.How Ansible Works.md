# How Ansible Works

Ansible operates by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules," to them. These programs are written to be resource models of the desired state of the system. Ansible then executes these modules and removes them when finished. The nodes are left in the desired state, with no residual daemon or extra software installed.

### Common Use Cases for Ansible

1. **Configuration Management:**
   - Automating the setup and maintenance of system configurations across multiple servers.
   - Ensuring consistency across environments (development, testing, production).

2. **Application Deployment:**
   - Automating the deployment of applications, including setting up servers, installing dependencies, and configuring services.

3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
   - Managing infrastructure resources like servers, networks, and storage in a programmatic way, often used in conjunction with cloud providers.

4. **Orchestration:**
   - Coordinating complex workflows and deployments that involve multiple systems and environments.

5. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
   - Integrating with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, deployment, and updates.

6. **Security and Compliance:**
   - Automating security updates, patches, and compliance checks to ensure systems meet regulatory requirements.
